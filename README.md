# Tips for Individual Contributors and Consultants

Random consulting musings learned from the best I’ve worked with:
- show up daily, or at least inform people when you won’t
- prioritize and explain why
- provide frequent & honest updates
- state facts
- instead of opinions, make them recommendations
- short term consulting gigs should be educational and focused on certain topics
- for transformation you need time and constant collaboration, i.e. months if not years of engagement
- provide more than one option with pros and cons for each
- never communicate in anger
- log every single decision including when and which parties were involved
- (probably controversial) customer is always right - in the ultimate goals they seek
- (probably controversial) customer is probably wrong - in their methodology in seeking these goals. For instance, they will ask for a buggy or teleportation where they need a car or a rocket
- 5 whys is good to have, 2 is must
- Conway’s law is your friend and enemy when solutioning. Take your tech solution and design around org structure. Kubernetes and microservices works best. Good luck getting the teams to transition from existing monoliths

- you’re a SME is a certain area and expected to provide best practices related to that area. This does not preclude you from chiming in other areas especially if you can add value based on your past experience.

- never take sides on the client side, explain pros and cons of each approach.
- skimping on security is unethical
- software developer will always underestimate the effort required
- often, your customers are the developers who have to maintain your software and the execs who write the checks, middle management is there to enable and guide you

- read as much documentation as possible on the client side
- generate documentation for your own work
- victory is an illusion, don’t get too comfortable
- defeat is a learning experience
- state your fair price, some would say double it
- Be kind but firm when saying no
- Never mock a client system however antiquated, bad or quirky for it’s the one making money that they’re using to pay you
 -   trust but verify
 -   Send summary email after each meeting
 -   Keep asking questions until they trot out the person with the answer
 -   Find out what the rare skills are. Acquire them. Keep doubling your rate until you don’t get any takers. Profit
-    have to be able to look someone in the eye and ask them for extra effort occasionally
-    Run towards the fire for exec visibility
-    Continuous bad news - deliver updates in small batches don’t wait a while to drop a big update

- not all conflict is bad. In fact, no conflict is a bad sign. Also, constant unproductive conflict is bad.
